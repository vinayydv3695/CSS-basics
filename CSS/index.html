<h1>this is page for ch 1115</h1>
 <p> As various places throughout the world react to Dr. Vegapunk's announcement of Joy Boy, Vegapunk reveals that back then the Twenty Kingdoms formed the World Government to counter Joy Boy leading to a war. Meanwhile Stussy refuses to leave Egghead due to Vegapunk's death and Zoro and Jinbe continue to head to the Thousand Sunny. Vegapunk reveals that the war ended with Joy Boy's defeat, but the war left permanent damage as the water level throughout the world rose 200 meters and the islands people live on are pieces of those continents. Vegapunk then reveals the cause of this are Ancient Weapons which still exist and waiting to be used which suggests the war never came to an end.
